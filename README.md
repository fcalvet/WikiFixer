# WikiFixer
"Fixes" new Vector theme of MediaWiki currently deployed to some specific Wikipedia and Wiktionnary.
Removes undue margins leaving only the space for the sidebar.

If you have a Wiki account, other methods are more suited:
* dedicated setting to continue using the previous theme
* using the content of `fixer.js` as a [user cutomisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Customisation)

If you don't have a Wiki account, you can also consider more general alternatives that can use the content of `fixer.js`:
* as a UserScript with Violentmonkey or Tampermonkey
* as a UserStyle with Stylus or GreaseMonkey

Thanks @PoorPocketsMcNewHold for [pointing these out.](https://github.com/fcalvet/WikiFixer/issues/1)
